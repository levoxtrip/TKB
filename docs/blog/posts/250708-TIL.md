# 25-07-08 - Today I Learned...
Today I learned about acceleration and how to use the device acceleration in p5.js

Acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes over time.

`Acceleration = Change in velocity / time taken`

Speeding up -> positive acceleration
Slowing down -> negative acceleration



for current acceleration you can use
`accelerationX,accelerationY,accelerationZ`

for previours frames acceleration you can use
`pAccelerationX,pAccelerationY,pAccelerationZ`

To limit the length of the float value use `accelerationX.toFixed(2)`.
