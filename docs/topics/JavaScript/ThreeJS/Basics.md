# Basics

Three.JS is build on top of WebGL.
You can download the examples from the Three.JS site here
[Github Examples](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)

![Structure of Three.JS](./img/BasicStructureThree.JS.png)

We create out of the single elements groups.

We have the `Scene` which holds all the information about the actual experience and the objects in a hierarchal way.
The `Camera` views the scene and tells the renderer what we looking at.
The `Renderer` responsible to give the user the images we want to see.

# Hierarchal structure of scene

We have a parent-child relationship in our scene and between the meshes. Children of a parent will inherit
properties from the parent mesh.
So if we group elements the children of the group will be transformed relatively from the parents values.

# Setup

To install three js in your project `npm install three`

To import the entire t3js library to our file
`import * as THREE from 'three'`

## Add a Scene

The scene is like a container for objects, lights and particles etc.

In THREE.JS you can have one or multiple scenes. You add the meshes that you create to the Scenes you want.

```js
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
```

## Add a Mesh

A mesh is composed out of geometry(shape) and a material(surface color). We need to add both to the `Mesh` object. We then add the
mesh to the scene.

```js
const cubeGeo = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
//We pass an object into the material containing all the options for that material
const cubeMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: "red" });

const cubeMesh = new THREE.Mesh(cubeGeo, cubeMat);

scene.add(cubeMesh);
```

## Create a group

```JS
const group = new THREE.Group();
group.add(cubeMesh)
group.add(cubeMesh);
```

By changing the transformations of the group we apply it to all the children of the group.

## Add a Camera

To see the elements in our scene we need to add a Camera

```js
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
  fieldOfView,
  aspectRatio,/*window.innerWidth/window.innerHeight,*/
  near /* everything closer thant this you wont see */
  further /*anything further than this you wont see*/

);
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
  75,
  window.innerWidth/window.innerHeight,
  0.1,
  30
)
// We need to move the camera back otherwise camera and object are both at (0,0,0)
camera.position.z = 5;

scene.add(camera);
```

We need to pass a canvas html element to our website that shows our Three.JS scene.
`canvas class="canvasClass"></canvas>`
In the JS file we then grab that element and reference it to the renderer because it takes the canvas as an object as input.
`const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas.canvasClass)`

## Add renderer

The renderer renders the scene from the camera point of view and draws it onto a canvas.
We need to specify the `canvas` property corresponding to the HTML `<canvas>` element that we add to the page.
For that we can use`document.querySelector(...)`

```JS
//Because we gonna use the canvas often for multiple operations it makes sense to assign it to a variablle
const canvas = document.querySelector('canvasClassName')
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
  canvas:canvas
})
//To specify how big it should be rendered
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth,window.innerHeight)
renderer.render(scene,camera);
```

If we would just call `renderer.render(...)` it would just render the scene one time.

In order to render the scene on every frame we create a function that executes at the speed of
the browsers framerate. We then call the renderer in that function. At the end we need to call
the function one time so it goes into the loop.

```JS
function animate() => {
  renderer.render(scene,camera);
  window.requestAnimationFrame(animate)
}
animate();
```

So anytime we want to make changes to the scene we need to set it before we call the animate loop because
renderer basically takes a snapshot of the current scene and shows it for that frame.

# Resizing Scene/Canvas depending on screen size

To make the canvas fit our viewport we use `window.innerWidth/.innerHeight`

We also need to get rid of the default margins of the browsers

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

To fix the canvas at the top

```css
.canvas {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  outline: none; /*blue outline when drag and dropping*/
}
```

To remove any kind of scrolling we can use

```css
html,
body {
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

To handle resizing the canvas we need to know when the window gets resized.
For that we listen to the `resize` event of the window.
`window.addEventListener("resize", () => {})`

When we do changes to the camera and the `camera.aspect` we need to call `camera.updateProjectionMatrix()`.

```JS
//(eventName, callback function)
window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
  camera.aspect = window.innerWidth/window.innerHeight;
  camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
  renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth/window.innerHeight);

})
```

# Handling pixel ratio

Because different devices can have different pixel ratios we should
adapt the `pixelRatio` of the renderer to the pixel ratio to the
screen of our device.
To avoid performance issues on devices with higher pixel ratios we
set the maximum pixel ratio to 2 with the `Math.min()`.

`renderer.setPixelRatio(Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio,2))`

We add this to the `window.addEventListener("resize",()=>{})`

# Fullscreen

You first need to decide what interaction will trigger the fullscreen.
You could use a HTML button or a double click for example.
To toggle between fullscreen and no fullscreen every time we
execute the action we check if window is already in fullscreen.
The fullscreen method is linked with the html-element. So we need
to define which element we want to show in fullscreen.

```JS
window.addEventListener("dblclick",()=> {
  if(!document.fullscreenElement){
    canvas.requestFullscreen()
  } else {
    document.exitFullscreen()
  }
})

```

To make sure this also works in other browser like _Safari_
we need to extend this with `document.webkitFullscreen`

```JS
window.addEventListener("dblclick",()=>{
  const fullscreenElement = document.fullscreenElement || document.webkitFullscreenElement
  if(!fullscreenElement){
    if(canvas.requestFullscreen){
      canvas.requestFullscreen()
    } else if(canvas.webkitRequestFullscreen){
      canvas.webkitRequestFullscreen();
    }
  } else {
    if(document.exitFullscreen){
      document.exitFullscreen();
    } else if(document.webkitExitFullscreen){
      document.webkitExitFullscreen();
    }
  }

})
```

# Antialiasing

## Get the device pixel ration we can use

`window.devicePixelRatio`

## Set the pixel ration

`renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio)`

Because of different devices and ultra high pixel ratios we want to limit the max pixel ratio so
the code stays performant

```JS
const maxPixelRatio = Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio,2);
renderer.setPixelRatio(maxPixelRatio);
```

## Add antialisaing to renderer

```JS
const renderer = new THREE.renderer({
  canvas:canvas,
  antialias:true;
})
```

# Transforming Objects

When we set the different parameters and transformations to our meshes we set the _local_ rotation, scale, and transform.

All classes that inherit from the `Object3D` class possess `position, scale, rotate, quaternion` properties.

All these properties will internally be compiled to Matrices by Three.JS.

## To see the axes in our scene

```JS
const axesHelper = new THREE.AxesHelper(2);
scene.add(axesHelper);
```

red = x
green = y
blue = z

## Set Positions

To set the position we can set the single axes

```JS
cubeMesh.position.x = 1 //x right,left
cubeMesh.position.z = 1 // backward/forward
cueMesh.position.y = 1 // up and down
```

The unity of 1 is up to you. It can be 1 centimeter, 1 meter or even 1 kilometer. It makes sense to adapt the unit to the size of what you want to build.

We also can use a `Vector3`

```JS
cubeMesh.position = new Vector3(0.1,0.0,0.3);
```

or even copy a vector to set the position

```JS
const tempPosition = new Vector3(0.4,0.1,0.8);
cubeMesh.position.copy(tempPosition);

```

## Set Scale

To set scale of single axis
`cubeMesh.scale.y = 2`

or use `.set()` to set all three values at once
`cubeMesh.scale.set(1,2,3)`

or
`group.scale.setScalar(2)`

## Set Rotation

There are two ways of handling rotations in Three.JS. You can use the `rotation` properties, which are expressed in _Euler_ angles in radians.
To create like half a rotation you can use `Math.PI`.

```JS
const a = new THREE.Euler(0,1,1.57, 'XYZ');
//Convert Vector 3 to euler
const b = new THREE.Vector3(1,0,1);
b.applyEuler(a);
```

Rotate 90Â°
`cubeMesh.rotation.y = Math.PI/2`

There is also a Three.JS utility we can use to convert radians to degree
`cubeMesh.rotation.y = THREE.MathUtils.degToRad(45)`

We also can use the `.quaternion` to set the rotation of an element. It is another way to express rotation.

Three.JS by default will always apply the rotation by the order XYZ even when in the code the Y rotation comes
before the x rotation.

If you want to change the order how it applies the rotation we can use
`cubeMesh.rotation.reorder('YXZ')`. this needs to be called before we are calling the rotations

## Look at object

The `.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0,-1,0))` method allows us to let an object look at a certain point,object or position. The object will automatically rote its `-z` axis towards the target.

# Animations

We want to execute a function that moves the objects and renders each frame regardless of the frame rate.

For that we can use the JS function `window.requestAnimationFrame()`.
It executes the function you provide it _on the next frame_.

To get reference of the time we can initialize a clock.

`const clock = new THREE.Clock()`

With `clock.getElapsedTime()` we get the difference between when the method got called and when we first initialized the clock.

## Get delta time

```JS
const clock = new THREE.Clock();
let previousTime = 0;
const renderLoop = () => {
  const currentTime = clock.getElapsedTime();
  const delta = currentTime - previousTime;

  previousTime = currentTime;
}
```

```JS
let time = Date.now()
const renderLoop = () => {
  const currentTime = Date.now()
  const deltaTime = currentTime-time;
  time = currentTime;

  mesh.rotation.y += 0.01 *deltaTime
}
```

With that `delta` we can create experiences that are independent of the speed of your device.

```JS
const clock = new THREE.Clock();
let previousTime = 0;

const renderLoop = () => {
  let currenTime = clock.getElapsedTime();
  const delta = currentTime-previousTime;

  previousTime = currenTime;

  cubeMesh.rotation.y += THREE.MathUtils.degToRad(1) * delta * 20;
  renderer.render(scene,camera);
  window.requestAnimationFrame(renderLoop)
}
renderLoop()
```

## Rotate object in circle

```JS
const time = new THREE.Clock();
const renderLoop = () => {
  const elapsedTime = time.getElapsedTime();

  mesh.position.x = Math.cos(elapsedTime);
  mesh.position.y = Math.sin(elapsedTime);
}
renderLoop();
```

## Let object/camera follow path

```JS
const points = [
  new THREE.Vector3(1,0,2),
  new THREE.Vector3(0,0,2),
  new THREE.Vector3(1,0,3),
  new THREE.Vector3(1,2,2),

]

//To close the path add true as second parameter to function
const path = new THREE.CatmullRowCurve3(points);
const animate = () => {
  const time = Date.now()
  const t = (time/2000%6) /6;
  const position = path.getPointAt(t);
  cam.position.copy(position)
  renderer.render()
  requestAnimationFrame();
}
```

To orient the object we need the normalised tanged vector of the position.

```JS
const tangent = path.getTangentAt(t).normalize();
cam.lookAt(position.clone().add(tangent));
```

It gets interesting to use mouseScroll to move the animation.

[Scroll Interaction](#scrolling)

## Animate with a Library

To get specific animations it can make sense to use specific JS animation libraries like [GSAP](https://gsap.com/)

### GSAP

To add `GSAP` we need to at it to our project
`npm install --save gsap@latest`

`import gsap from 'gsap'`

In `GSAP` we can create a `Tween` which is an animation from A to B
with `gsap.to(...)`
Because `GSAP` has a built-in `requestAnimationFrame` you don't need to update the animation.

```JS
gsap.to(mesh.position,{duration:1,delay:1,x:2})
const renderLoop = () => {
  renderer.render(scene,camera);
  window.requestAnimationFrame(renderLoop)
}
renderLoop()
```

# Geometries

In Three.js geometries are composed out of vertices - which are point coordinates in 3D space - and
facets - which are triangles that join the vertices into surfaces.

Geometries are used to create Meshes but also for particles.

Three.js own geometries are called _primitives_.

## Create own Geometry

If you want to create Geometry that is complex or with a precise shape it makes sense to create it in a 3D software. But for not to complex geometry we can use `new THREE.BufferGeometry();`

We start with instantiating a BufferGeometry
`const buffGeo  = new THREE.BufferGeometry()`

To add vertices to the geometry we save them in a JS `Float32Array`

```JS
const positionsArray = new Float32Array([
    0, 0, 0, // First vertex
    0, 1, 0, // Second vertex
    1, 0, 0  // Third vertex
])
```

Before you can pass the Array data into the _BufferGeometry_ we need to transform it into a _BufferAttribute_.

`const positionAttribute = new THREE.BufferAttribute(positionsArray,3)`
The `3` defines how many values define one vertex attribute.

Finally we can this attribute to the _BufferGeometry_ by using `.setAttribute(nameAttribute,value)`
`geometry.setAttribute('position',positionAttribute)`
The Three.js shader will look for the `position` name to assign the values to the position of the vertices.
Then the faces will created depending of the order of the vertices in the array.

Another example:

```JS
//Create geometry
const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry()
// Create Array with vertices points
//Float32 Array only allows to store Floats and the length of the array is fixed
//you also can set the length of the array with new Float32Array(9)
const vertices = new Float32Array([
  -1.0, -1.0, 1.0,//First vertex
  1.0, -1.0, 1.0,//second vertex
  1.0, 1.0, 1.0,//third vertex

    1.0, 1.0, 1.0,
  -1.0, 1.0, 1.0,
  -1.0, -1.0, 1.0,
]);
// pass array into BufferAttribute to store information about the position of the vertices
geometry.setAttribute('position',new THREE.BufferAttribute(vertices,3));

```

in `.setAttribute()` we also can manipulate the `uv`position of the vertices, `normals` etc.

The THREE.JS _primitives_ also use `BufferGeometry` under the hood.

### Create random triangles

```JS
const geo = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
//create 50 triangles = 450 values
const count = 50;
//50 *3 *3 = 50 triangle with 3 vertex points which need 3 values
const ranTrianglePoints = new Float32Array(50*3*3);

for(let i = 0; i< count*3*3;i++){
  ranTrianglePoints[i] = (Math.random()-0.5) *4
}
const positionAttribute = new THREE.BufferAttribute(ranTrianglePoints,3);
geo.setAttribute('position',positionAttribute);

```

## Three.js Primitives

All Three.js inherit from the `ButterGeometry` class.
You can find all the primitive geometries from Three.JS in the documentation.

### BoxGeometry

```JS
const box = new THREE.BoxGeometry({
  width,
  height,
  depth,
  widthSegments,
  heightSegments,
  depthSegments
})
```

### PlaneGeometry

```JS
const plane = new THREE.PlaneGeometry({
  width,height,widthSegments,heightSegments
})
```

### CircleGeometry

`const geometry = new THREE.CircleGeometry(radius,segments)`

### SphereGeometry

```JS
const sphereGeo = new THREE.SphereGeometry(0.5,32,32)
```

### ConeGeometry

`const geometry = new THREE.ConeGeometry(radius,height,radialSegments)`

### CylinderGeometry

```JS
const cylinderGeometry = new THREE.CylinderGeometry(0.5,0.5,1,32);
```

### RingGeometry

To create a flat ring or a portion of a flat ring
`const ring = new THREE.RingGeometry(innerRadius,outerRadius,numSegments)`

### TorusGeometry

To create a ring with thickness - like a donut
`const torus = new THREE.TorusGeometry(radius,radiusTube,radialSegments,tubularSegments,arc)`

Other geometries are
`DodecahedronGeometry` - 12 faces sphere
`OctahedronGeometry` - 8 faces sphere
`TetrahedronGeometry` - 4 faces sphere

### ShapeGeometry

To create your own shapes

```JS
const x = 0, y = 0;

const heartShape = new THREE.Shape();

heartShape.moveTo( x + 5, y + 5 );
heartShape.bezierCurveTo( x + 5, y + 5, x + 4, y, x, y );
heartShape.bezierCurveTo( x - 6, y, x - 6, y + 7,x - 6, y + 7 );
heartShape.bezierCurveTo( x - 6, y + 11, x - 3, y + 15.4, x + 5, y + 19 );
heartShape.bezierCurveTo( x + 12, y + 15.4, x + 16, y + 11, x + 16, y + 7 );
heartShape.bezierCurveTo( x + 16, y + 7, x + 16, y, x + 10, y );
heartShape.bezierCurveTo( x + 7, y, x + 5, y + 5, x + 5, y + 5 );
```

### TubeGeometry

Creates a tube that extrudes a long a 3d curve

`const geometry = new THREE.TubeGeometry( path, 20, 2, 8, false );`

### ExtrudeGeometry

Creates extrudes geometry from a path shape.

```JS
const length = 12, width = 8;

const shape = new THREE.Shape();
shape.moveTo( 0,0 );
shape.lineTo( 0, width );
shape.lineTo( length, width );
shape.lineTo( length, 0 );
shape.lineTo( 0, 0 );

const extrudeSettings = {
	steps: 2,
	depth: 16,
	bevelEnabled: true,
	bevelThickness: 1,
	bevelSize: 1,
	bevelOffset: 0,
	bevelSegments: 1
};

const geometry = new THREE.ExtrudeGeometry( shape, extrudeSettings );
```

### LatheGeometry

Creates meshes with axial symmetry like vases. The lathe rotates around the Y Axis

```JS
const points = [];
for ( let i = 0; i < 10; i ++ ) {
	points.push( new THREE.Vector2( Math.sin( i * 0.2 ) * 10 + 5, ( i - 5 ) * 2 ) );
}
const geometry = new THREE.LatheGeometry( points );
```

### TextGeometry

Because it is an add-on we need to import it
`import {TextGeometry} from 'three/addons/geometries/TextGeometry.js'`

Three.js needs the font in a json format called typeface.
We can convert a font [here](https://gero3.github.io/facetype.js/)
There are also fonts in the `/node_modules/three/examples/fonts/` which we can put in the `/static/` folder.
Another way is to directly import the json file in your script
`import typefaceFont from 'three/examples/fonts/helvetiker_regular.typeface.json`

To load a font we need the Three.js class `FontLoader`

```JS
import {TextGeometry} from 'three/addons/geometries/TextGeometry.js'
...
const loader = new FontLoader();

loader.load( 'fonts/helvetiker_regular.typeface.json',  ( font ) => {

	const geometry = new TextGeometry( 'Hello three.js!', {
		font: font,
		size: 80,
		depth: 5,
		curveSegments: 12,
		bevelEnabled: true,
		bevelThickness: 10,
		bevelSize: 8,
		bevelOffset: 0,
		bevelSegments: 5
	} );
} );
```

To create 3D fonts is quite some work for Three.js because of the amount of segments and vertices. Try to reduce the `curveSegments` and `bevelSegments` as much as you can.

#### Center the text

In Three.js geometry has a _bounding_ which gives how much space the geometry takes in the scene. It can be a _sphere_(Default) or a _ box_.

We can use these boundings to position our text.
For text it makes sense to use a box as the bounding so we have to tell three.js to calculate the box
`textGeo.computeBoundingBox()`
`console.log(textGeometry.boundingBox)`

We then look for the `.max` properties and move the geometry inside the mesh - so the mesh stays centered in the scene.

```JS
textGeo.translate(
  -textGeo.boundingBox.max.x * 0.5,
  -textGeo.boundingBox.max.y *0.5,
  -textGeo.boundingBox.max.z * 0.5
)
```

The bounding box has a bevel which we would need to subtract as well to be more precise.

```JS
textGeo.translate(
  -textGeo.boundingBox.max.x * 0.5-0.02,
  -textGeo.boundingBox.max.y *0.5-0.02,
  -textGeo.boundingBox.max.z * 0.5-0.02
)
```

Three.js has a function for this to make it easier `.center()`
`textGeo.center()`

### Add multiple Meshes with one call

`scene.add(plane,sphere,box)`

## Load in gltf files into THREE.JS

```JS
import { GLTFLoader } from "three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader";
const loader = new GLTFLoader();
loader.load("src/assets/hand.glb",(gltf)=> {
  console.log(gltf.scene);
  gltf.scene.rotation.y = ...
  gltf.scene.position.y =
  hand = gltf.scene
  scene.add(gltf.scene);
})
```

# Fog

To create fog around the center
`scene.fog = new THREE.Fog(0x000000,15,25);`

You then should also set the renderer clear color to the fog color
`renderer.setClearColor('0x000000');`

# Calculate distance camera and a certain mesh

We can use the distanceTo function to calculate it.

```JS
cubeMesh.position.distanceTo(camera.position)
```

So we actually can trigger something if the camera reaches an object. If the distance is < than show something

# Delete Margin of Three.JS scene

Deletes the margin and the scrollbar

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

# Controls

## Controls

Three.JS has a lot of different already pre-build controls integrated which you can use for interactions.
![Three.JS Controls](https://Three.JS.org/docs/index.html?q=controls#api/en/extras/Controls)

_DeviceOrientationControls:_ Retrieves the device orientation of your device allows it and it rotates the camera accordingly.

_FlyControls:_ Enables you to move the camera like if you were on a spaceship. You can rotate on all 3 axes, go forward and backward.

_FirstPersonControls:_ Like the _FlyControls_ but just with a fixed up axis. Like a flying bird that can't do a barrel roll.

_PointerLockControls:_ Its a JS API that hides the cursor, centers it, keeps sending the movement in the `mousemove` event callback. It allows you to create FPS games. But it just handles the camera rotation. Your have to do the camera position yourself.

_OrbitControls:_ Allows you to rotate around a point with the left mouse btn and translate with the right mouse btn, and zoom in with the mouse wheel.

_TrackballControls:_ They are similar to _OrbitControls_ but without any limits for the vertical angle which allows upside down rotations.

## Orbit Controls

To import _OrbitCamera_ we need to import it into our sketch
`import {OrbitControls} from 'three/addons/controls/OrbitControls.js'`

Then set it in the code

```JS
import {OrbitControls} from 'three/addons/controls/OrbitControls.js'

const controls = new OrbitControls(camera,canvas);

//update controls in animate
function animate () {
  //required if controls.enableDamping or controls.autoRotate set to true
  controls.update();
}
```

By default the _OrbitControls_ is looking at the center of the scene.
With the `target` property we can change where it is looking.
`controls.target.y = -2`

To smooth the animation of the `OrbitControls` we can use `.enableDamping` property and set it to `true`
`controls.enableDamping = true`

## Map controls

[Map Controls](https://Three.JS.org/examples/misc_controls_map.html)

## Fly controls

[Fly Controls](https://Three.JS.org/examples/misc_controls_fly.html)
The camera follows where the mouse is without clicking thing mouse

## First Person controls

It goes under _pointerlock_ in the examples.

```JS
const controls = new PointerLockControls(camera, document.body);

controls.addEventListener('lock', function () {
  menu.style.display = 'none';
});

controls.addEventListener('unlock', function () {
  menu.style.display = 'block'
}
```

## Drag controls

Drag elements
[Trackball Controls](https://Three.JS.org/examples/?q=controls#misc_controls_drag)

## Trackball controls

[Trackball Controls](https://Three.JS.org/examples/misc_controls_trackball.html)

# Camera

## PerspectiveCamera

_FOV_: The field of view is how large your vision angle is.
The bigger that angle the more you can see from the scene/experience but also the elements in that scene get smaller and more distorted.
The smaller the angle the less you can see from the scene but the elements are gonna appear larger.
![Field of View](https://github.com/PineappleBeer/Three.JS-journey/raw/master/03-basic-scene/files/video-1.gif)

In conventional photography a lot of people use 50Â° or 35Â° field of view. Play with values between `45` and `75`

`const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera()`

_Aspect Ratio_- In most cases the width of the canvas divided by the height.

_Near_ - Anything within the distance between your camera and the near property you won't be able to see. Stick with numbers like 0.1 or 0.3. Values can be imagined in meters
_Far_ - Anything after the distance between your camera and the far property you won'T be able to see. Stick numbers like 200.

### Define how far/close orbin camera can move

```JS
const controls = new OrbitControls(camera,renderer,domElement);
controls.minDistance = 5;
controls.maxDistance=15;
```

### Look at specific target with orbit camera

`controls.targer.set(0,0,0)`

## Orthographic camera

For orthographic renders without perspective. Elements will have the same size on the screen regardless of their distance from the camera.
All the lines are parallel. The values that the camera asks are the distance between the center of the camera
and the outer edges of the box.
The orthografic camera requires:
_left_:left edge
_right_:right edge
_top_:top edge
_bottom_:bottom edge
_near_:
_far_:

To not get a distortion of your elements we need to multiple the _left_ and _right_ values with the aspect `aspectRatio`

```JS
const aspectRatio = window.innerWidth/window.innerHeight

const orthoCamera = new THREE.OrthographicCamera(
  -1*aspectRatio,
  1 * aspectRatio,
  1,
  -1,
  0.1,
  200
)
camera.position.z = 5
```

## Change the aspect of the camera

`camera.aspect = 4`

## Render Multiple Camera

### ArrayCamera

To render multiple cameras performant for example for VR we can use
`ArrayCamera`

Each camera will render a specific area o the canvas.

### StereoCamera

The `StereoCamera` is used to render the scene through two camera that mimic the eyes in order to create a parallax effect. You need a VR headset or red and blue glasses to see the result.

### CubeCamera

The `CubeCamera` is used to get a render facing each direction(forward, backward, leftward, rightward, upward, and downward) to create a render of the surrounding. You can use it to create an environmentmap for reflection or a shadow map.

# Materials

Materials are used to put color on each visible pixel of the geometry.
We write the algorithms that decide which color gets displaced at which pixel in shaders.

![Material Overview](./img/Three.JSMaterialOverview.png)

We can use one material for multiple meshes.

## Mesh Basic Material

`THREE.MeshBasicMaterial` is a material that doesn't react to light.

```JS
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
  //We ether can assign colors by name or by hexadecimal color: 0xff0000, or even by an instance off the Color class
  color: 'red',
  transparent:true,
  opacity:0.5,
})

// We also can change the properties after creating the Material
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
  color:'red'
})
material.transparent =false;
material.color = new THREE.Color(0xff00ff);
```

There are multiple ways to set the color:

```JS
material.color = new THREE.Color('#ff0000')
material.color = new THREE.Color('#ff00')
material.color = new THREE.Color('red')
material.color = new THREE.Color('rgb(255,0,0)')
material.color = new THREE.Color('0xff0000')
```

## Set transparency of material

```JS
material.transparency = true;
material.opacity = 0.5;

```

## Control transparency with texture

To be able to use an alpha mat on an object we need to enable transparency of the material

```JS
material.transparency = true
material.alphaMat = alphaTexture
```

## Changing sites of material

Three.JS by default has one side materials. So with a plane if you Rotate
it 180Â° you wouldn't see the backside of the shape.

For that we can use `THREE.DoubleSide`
`material.side = THREE.DoubleSide`

`THREE.DoubleSide` is a Three.JS constant so we don't need to use `new`
If not necessary try to avoid _DoubleSide_ because it raises the number of triangles to render.

`THREE.BackSide` when you want to show the _Backside_ instead.

## Turn of/on if material reacts to fog

Materials react by default to fog. We can change that with
`material.fog = false`

## Wireframe Material

We set a property inside the Material `wireframe: true`

```JS
const mat = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: "red", wireframe:true})

```

## MeshLambert Material

The `MeshLambert` material is a really performant material but also has less realism and options.
It requires information from light.

## MeshPhong Material

With a MeshPong Material we get a light reflection/shininess property. The higher the value the more shiny is the material.
`material.shininess = 90`

To change the color of the reflection we can use the `.specular` property.
`material.specular = new THREE.Color("0xff0000")`

## MeshStandardMaterial

The `MeshStandardMaterial` is based on Physically based rendering(PBR) and gets used a lot in Three.js.
The material gets effected my light and allows to use properties like `roughness` and `metalness`.

```JS
const material = new THREE.MEshStandartMaterial();
material.color = new THREE.Color("blue");
material.map = colorTexture;
material.roughness = 0.3;
material.metalness = 0.6;
```

The `MeshStandardMaterial` also allows to add _ambient oclussion_ maps. These add shadows where the texture of the map is dark. So we create more contrast around the dark parts of the texture.
The `aoMap` requires a second set of uvs.

```JS
myGeo.geometry.setAttribute('uv2',new THREE.BufferAttribute(myGeo.geometry.attributes.uv.array,2))

material.aoMap = ambientOcclusionTexture
material.aoMapIntensity = 1

```

In a `MeshStandardMaterial` we also can add a _displacementMap_ to displace the vertices of the geometry. It is important that the geometry has enough vertices to work with otherwise it is gonna look weardly distorded.

`material.displacementMap = displaceTex`
`material.displaementScale = 0.05`

For the `metalness` and the `roughness` we can assign maps
`material.metallnessMap = metalNessTexture`
`material.roughnessMap = roughnessTexture`

If the result doesn't look as expected reset the `metalness` and `roughness` properties
`material.metalness = 0`
`material.roughness = 1`

We also can add the material specific normal map to add details without having a high subdivision of the geometry
`material.normalMap = normalTexture`
`material.normalScale.set(0.2,0.2)`

## MeshPhysicalMaterial

The `MeshPhysical` material has same properties like the `MeshStandard` but
has more properties like `reflectivity` and `clearcoat`

`reflectivity` allows you to have a reflective material which has a low `metalness` value.

```JS
const material = new THREE.PhysicalMaterial();
material.color = new THREE.Color(0xff33ff);
material.reflectivity = 0.3;
```

`clearcoat` is like a reflective gloss or like a wax on the car.

`material.clearcoat = 0.9`

![PhysicalMaterial Properties](https://Three.JS.org/examples/?q=clear#webgl_materials_physical_clearcoat)

## MeshNormalMaterial

This materials shows the normals of the object.
`const normalMat = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial()`

`MeshNormalMaterial` has also the property `.flatShading` which allows us to flatten the faces of the geometry - normals won't be interpolated between the vertices.

## MeshToonMaterial

The `MeshToonMaterial` is similar to the `MeshLambertMaterial` but creates a more toon style.
`material = new THREE.MeshToonMaterial()`
It creates a coloration with two steps - one for light and one for shadow.
With a gradient texture we can get more color steps.
`material.gradient = gradientTexture`

To make it work we need to set `.minFilter`, `.magFilter` and deactivate the generation of mipmaps

```JS
gradientTexture.minFilter = THREE.NearestFilter
gradientTexture.maxFilter = THREE.NearestFilter
gradientTexture.generateMipMaps = false
```

## MeshMatcapMaterial

The `MeshMatcapMaterial` can create a nice look while being very performant. It needs a texture that looks like a sphere

<iframe src="https://github.com/PineappleBeer/threejs-journey/raw/master/12-materials/files/1.jpg"></iframe>
The normal orientation relative to the camera decides which color the material is gonna pick for the vertex.

## MeshDepthMaterial

The `MeshDepthMaterial` will color the parts of a material according to the closeness of the pixel to the camera.

If can be useful if you want to create effects where you need to know how far the pixel is from the camera.

## PointsMaterial

When you work with particles it makes sense to use the `PointsMaterial`

## ShaderMaterial

To create material for your geometries from shaders you can use `ShaderMaterial` and `RawShaderMaterial`

## Environment map

With environment maps we can add images of the surrounding scene. They create more realistic reflection or refraction for your materials and lighting.

To add the environment map to our material we use the `.envMap` property.

Three.Js only supports cube environment maps. They contain 6 images each for one side of a environment.

To load a cube environmentmap we use `CubeTextureLoader`

```JS
const cubeTextureLoader = new THREE.CubeTextureLoader()
const environmentMapTexture = cubeTextureLoader.load([
    '/textures/environmentMaps/px.jpg',
    '/textures/environmentMaps/nx.jpg',
    '/textures/environmentMaps/py.jpg',
    '/textures/environmentMaps/ny.jpg',
    '/textures/environmentMaps/pz.jpg',
    '/textures/environmentMaps/nz.jpg'
])
material.envMap = environmentMapTexture
```

You can find environment maps on [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/)
But you need to convert the HDRI into a cubemap with [HRDI to Cubemap](https://matheowis.github.io/HDRI-to-CubeMap/).
Maybe convert the `png` into `jpg`

## Normals

Normals contain information about the direction of the outside of the face on each vertex of the mesh.
You can image normals as arrows coming out of the vertex of the geometry and pointing into a direction.

<iframe src="https://github.com/PineappleBeer/threejs-journey/raw/master/12-materials/files/normals.png"></iframe>

The material will then pick colors on the texture according to the normal orientation relative to the camera.
`material.matcap = matcapTexture`

You can find a big list of matcaps [here](https://github.com/nidorx/matcaps?tab=readme-ov-file)

To create your own matcap material you can render a sphere in front of a camera into a squared image.

## Textures

### What are Textures?

Textures are images that will cover the surface of your geometry.
There are different textures that create certain effects on the appearance of the object.

<iframe src="https://github.com/PineappleBeer/threejs-journey/raw/master/11-textures/files/color.jpg"></iframe>
_Color/Albedo:_ It takes the pixel of the texture and applies it to the geometry
<iframe src="https://github.com/PineappleBeer/threejs-journey/raw/master/11-textures/files/alpha.jpg"></iframe>
_Alpha:_ A grayscale image where the white parts define that the texture will be shown and the black parts won't.
<iframe src="https://github.com/PineappleBeer/threejs-journey/raw/master/11-textures/files/height.png"></iframe>
_Height:_ A grayscale image that moves the vertices of the geometry to create a relief effect. For that your geometry needs certain subdivision to be able to create the relief.
<iframe src="https://github.com/PineappleBeer/threejs-journey/raw/master/11-textures/files/normal.jpg"></iframe>
_Normal:_ Adds details but doesn't actually changes the geometry. It basically fakes to the light source that some faces of the geometry are oriented in a certain direction. Good way to add details without subdividing your geometry.
<iframe src="https://github.com/PineappleBeer/threejs-journey/raw/master/11-textures/files/ambientOcclusion.jpg"></iframe>
_Ambient Occlusion:_ Grayscale image that fakes shadow on the surface of the geometry.
<iframe src="https://github.com/PineappleBeer/threejs-journey/raw/master/11-textures/files/metalness.jpg"></iframe>
_Metalness:_ Grayscale image that specifies which parts of the geometry are metallic(white) and which parts are not(black)
<iframe src="https://github.com/PineappleBeer/threejs-journey/raw/master/11-textures/files/roughness.jpg"></iframe>
_Roughness:_ Grayscale image that defines which parts of the surface are rough(white) or smooth(black)

These textures we use to apply _Physically Based Rendering(PBR)_ to our scene to create realistic renders.

We can get good free materials at
[FreePBR.com](https://www.freepbr.com)

To load the textures into THREE.JS we need to first initialize a loader that loads the textures.

More information about [PBR here](https://marmoset.co/posts/basic-theory-of-physically-based-rendering/) [and here](https://marmoset.co/posts/physically-based-rendering-and-you-can-too/)

### Loading Textures

There are different ways to load textures.

#### Loading with native JS

With JS we need to create an `Image` instance, listen to the `load` event and the assign it to the `src` of the Image.

```JS
const Image = new Image()
const texture = new THREE.Texture(image)
Image.addEventListener('load',()=> {
  texture.needsUpdate = true
})
image.src = 'textures/.../filename.png'
// we then assign the texture to the map property of the material
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({texture})

```

#### Using Texture Loader

```JS
//Only create this once - even if you use the loader more often - its a utility class
const texLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();

// initialize the texture
const texture = textureLoader.load('path/to/file')

// assign texture to map property of a material
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial();
material.map = texture;
material.roughnessMap = textureRoughness;
material.roughnessMap = 0.1 // won't effect parts of the texture that aren't rough we only apply this value to the parts that are specifies as roughness
material.metalnessMap = textureMetall;
material.normalMap = normal; // normalmap holds information about how to fake the way light bounces of of this material.
material.displacementMap = heightMap; //The heightmap actually displaces the vertices of the Mesh
material.displacementScale = 0.1;
/*ambient occlusion is technique to add more depth and realism to the scene. it simulates how light is occluded or blocked where elements are close together or one elements throws shadows on another.
the ao map requires a second set of uvs. We can pass them from the actual geometry*/

const uv2 = new THREE.BufferAttribute(geometry.attribute.uv.array,2)//2 is for the item size x and y
geometry.setAttribute('uv2',uv2);
)
material.aoMap = grassAo;
material.aoMapIntensity = 1
```

We also can call this directly in the material initiation

```JS
const loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  map = loader.load("path")
})
```

If the loading of your functions not worked as you expected, in the `.load` function we can call three functions to control if the loading of the function worked properly.

```JS
textureLoader.load("path",
  () => {
    console.log('loading finished')
  },
  () => {
    console.log('loading progressing')
  },
  () => {
    console.log('loading error')
  }
)
```

#### Using Loading Manager

When you want to load multiple textures and be notified after the successful load we can also use the `LoadingManager`class and pass it into the `TextureLoader`

```JS
const loadingManager = new THREE.LoadingManager();
const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader(loadingManager)
// you the can listen to the different events of the Loading manager
loadingManager.onStart = () => {
  console.log('loading started')
}
loadingManger.onLoaded = () => {
  console.log('loading finished');
}
loadingManager.onProgress = () => {
  console.log('loading progressing')
}
loadingManger.onError = () => {
  console.log('loading error');
}
```

### UV unwrapping

_UV Unwrapping_ defines how the texture is wrapped around the surface of the geometry. Each vertex has a 2D coordinate on a flat square plane that defines which part of the texture will displaces at that vertex position.

<iframe src="https://github.com/PineappleBeer/threejs-journey/raw/master/11-textures/files/uvUnwrapping1.png"></iframe>

To see the uv coordinates you can use the
`geometry.attributes.uv` property.

Three.js creates these uv properties for it's primitives. But if you create your own geometry in a 3D software or you import geometry you need specify the uv coordinates and need to to the uv unwrapping yourself.

#### UV Maps

A _UV Map_ tells THREE.js how to map a texture on an object.
By default THREE.js maps textures differently than blender. Blender wraps a texture over all sides of an object.
Three.js maps the whole texture on one _face_.

### Transforming the texture

#### Repeat

Especially if you use texture on bigger surfaces it can make sense to change the repeat of the texture otherwise it gets streched a lot.

_Lets repeat this texture 10 times x and 10 times y_
`texture.repeat.x = 10`
`texture.repeat.y = 10`
`texture.repeat.set(10,10)`
To make this work we need to set the `wrapS` and `wrapT` property of the texture.

```JS
grassTexture.wrapT = grassTexture.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping
```

Another type of wrapping is `THREE.MirrorRepeatWrapping`

#### Offset

We can offset the texture with the `offset` property.
`texture.offset.x = 0.5`
`texture.offset.y = 0.5`

#### Rotation

To rotate the texture we use the `rotation` property.
`texture.rotation = Math.PI *0.25`
The rotation occurs around the bottom left corner which is the `0,0` uv coordinate.
To change the pivot point of the rotation you can use the `center` property

```JS
texture.rotation = Math.PI 0.25
texture.center.x = 0.5
texture.center.y = 0.5
```

#### Filtering and Mipmapping

_Mipmapping_ creates smaller versions of the texture - always halfed in size till 1x1. The GPU the picks the right texture for the render.
Three.js and the GPU handle this and we can decide which algorithm to use for that.
There are two types of filter alogrithms:

##### Minification

The _minification_ filter happens when pixels of the texture are smaller than the pixels of the render or the texture is to big for the surface it covers.
Different filter:

```JS
THREE.NearestFilter
THREE.LinearFilter
THREE.NearestMipmapNearestFilter
THREE.NearestMipmapLinearFilter
THREE.LinearMipmapNearestFilter
THREE.LinearMipmapLinearFilter//Default filter
```

To set the filter
`texture.minFilter = THREE.NearestFilter`

##### Magnification Filter

_Magnification_ filter works when the pixels of the texture are bigger thant the renders pixel - the texture is too small for the surface.
The texture gets then blurry because it gets stretched on the large surface.
Filter:
`THREE.NearestFilter`
`THREE.LinearFilter//Default`
`texture.magFilter = THREE.NearestFilter`

Generally `THREE.NearestFiler` is computationally cheaper than the other filter.
Also only mipmaps for the `minFilter` property. If you are using `THREE.NearestFilter` you don't need mipmaps and you can deactivate them with
`texture.generateMipmaps = false`
`texture.minFilter = THREE.NearestFilter`
This will creates less load for the GPU.

#### Texture Format and optimisation

Be aware of 3 factors when you prepare your textures:
_Weight_
_Size/Resolution_
_Data_

##### Weight

The users that are going to your website are going to download the textures. Use `.jpg`(lossy compression but lighter) or `.png`(lossless compression but heavier) for your files.

_Try to get an acceptable image but as light as possible_
[TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) can help.

##### Size

Try to reduce the size of the images as much as possible because every pixel of the image needs to get stored on the GPU - and with mipmapping even more pixel.

The size of your texture must have a power of 2
`512x512` `1024x1024` `512x2048`

or otherwise Three.js have to stretch the texture to the next power of two.

##### Data

For normal textures it makes sense to use `png` so you get a lossless compression.

##### Sources

To get good textures you can go to
[Poliigon](https://www.poliigon.com/)
[3Dtextures.me](https://3dtextures.me/)

## GLSL as Material

```JS
function createBackMaterial() {
   let m = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
     color: 0x66775f,
     side: THREE.BackSide,
     onBeforeCompile: (shader) => {
       shader.fragmentShader = `
         ${shader.fragmentShader}
       `.replace(
         `vec4 diffuseColor = vec4( diffuse, opacity );`,
         `
         vec3 col = mix(diffuse, diffuse + vec3(0.75), smoothstep(0.5, 0.7, vUv.y));
         vec4 diffuseColor = vec4( col, opacity );
         `
       );
     console.log(shader.fragmentShader);
     },
   });
   m.defines = { USE_UV: "" };
   return m;
 };
```

## Displace material via displacement map

```JS
const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
const displacementMap = textureLoader.load(`src/assets/img/height.png`)
displacementMap.wrapS = displacementMap.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
```

# Scene

The `scene` object has `.children` property which allows us to access the children of the scene and more importantly
loop through all the children of the scene.

```JS
scene.children.forEach((child) => {
  //Test if child is actually a mesh
  if(child instanceof THREE.Mesh){
  child.rotation.x += 0.01;
  }
})
```

To be more performant because you don't want to loop through all the children on every frame you create a group
add that to the scene and then loop through the children of the group. Now we only loop through the elements that
we really want to.

```JS
...
const group = new THREE.Group();
group.add(plane,sphere,cylinder);
scene.add(group);

group.children.forEach((child)=> {
  if(child instance of THREE.mesh){
    child.rotation.x +=0.2;
  }
})
```

## Group

If you have multiple objects that belong together and maybe need to be transformed together it can make sense to group them together with the `Group` class which inherits also from `Object3D`.

```JS
const group = new THREE.Group()
group.scale.y = 2
scene.add(group)
```

You then can add objects to the group

```JS
const boxGeo = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1,1,1);
const boxMat = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color:0xff0000})
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(boxGeo,boxMat);
group.add(mesh)
```

## Frustum Culling

Three.js calculates if the geometry is on the screen and if not the object won't be rendered.

# Light

## AmbientLight

In reality light reflects of all the surface.
To create some light even behind our objects we want to add an `AmbientLight` to the scene.

```JS
const ambLight = new THREE.AmbientLight(0xffffff,0.2);
ambLight.intensity = 0.5;
scene.add(ambLight);
```

## Point Light

A `Point Light` has a small light source and spreads uniformly in every direction
`const pointLight = new THREE.PointLight(color,intensity)`

```JS
const pointLight = new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff,1);
pointLight.position.set(5,5,5);
scene.add(pointLight);
```

We also can control how the intensity of the light fades and how fast it is fading
`const pointLight = new THREE.PointLight(color,intensity,distance,decay)`
`const pointLight = new THREE.PointLight(0xff0000,0.5,8,5)`

## DirectionalLight

If you want a light like the sun you can use a `THREE.DirectionalLight('color',intensity)`

To have it shine more from the side we move it
`directionalLight.position.set(1,0.2,0.);`

## HemisphereLight

The `HemisphereLight` is similar to the `AmbientLight` but it emits a different color from the ground than from the sky.
`const hemLight = new THREE.HemisphereLight('colorSky','colorGround',intensity)`

## RectAreaLight

Works like a rectangle light. It mixes directional light with diffuse light.
`const rectAreaLight = new THREE.ReactAreaLight(color,intensity,widthRect,height)`
`const rectAreaLight = new THREE.RectAreaLight(0x0000ff, 2, 1, 1)`

This light only works with MeshStandardMaterial and MeshPhysicalMaterial

```JS
rectAreaLight.position.set(-2,0,1)
// to look at center of the scene
rectAreaLight.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3())
```

## SpotLight

Works like a flashlight with a cone of light starting at a point and oriented in one direction.
`distance` - At which distance drops intensity to 0
`angle` - How big is the beam
`penumbra`- How diffused is contour of the beam
`decay` - how fast does the light dim
`const spotLight = new THREE.SpotLight(color,intensity,distance,angle,penumbra,decay)`
`const spotLight = new THREE.SpotLight(0xff0022,0.5,10,Math.PI * 0.1,0.25,1)`

To rotate the `SpotLight` we have to add its `.target` to the scene

```JS
const spotLight = new THREE.SpotLight(0xff0022,0.5,10,Math.PI*0.1,0.25,1);
spotLight.position.set(0,3,2);
spotLight.target.position.x = -0.5;
scene.add(spotLight.target);

```

## Performance optimizations

Try to add as few lights as possible and use the light that has the lowest performance cost because lights are intensive to compute.

_Minimal Cost:_

- AmbientLight
- HemisphereLight
  _Moderate cost:_
- DirectionalLight
- PointLight
  _High Cost_
- SpotLight
- RectAreaLight

### Baking lights

Baking is a technique where we already can bake in the lightings of the scene into the material texture so we don't need
real time lighting.

### Light Helpers

We can use Three.js helpers to see how the lights are positioned

```JS
const hemisphereLightHelper = new THREE.HemisphereLightHelper(hemisphereLight,0.2);
scene.add(hemisphereLight);

const directionalLightHelper = new THREE.DirectionalLightHelper(diretionalLight,0.2);
scene.add(directionalLight);

const pointLightHelper = new THREE.PointLightHelper(pointLight,0.2);
scene.add(pointLightHelper)

const spotLightHelper = new THREE.SpotLightHelper(spotLight);
scene.add(spotLightHelper);
//needs to be updated
window.requestAnimationFrame(()=> {
  spotLightHelper.update();
})
```

```JS
import { RectAreaLightHelper } from 'three/examples/jsm/helpers/RectAreaLightHelper.js'

const rectAreaLightHelper = new RectAreaLightHelper(reactAreaLight)
scene.add(rectAreaLightHelper)
//needs to be updated
window.requestAnimationFrame(() =>
{
    rectAreaLightHelper.position.copy(rectAreaLight.position)
    rectAreaLightHelper.quaternion.copy(rectAreaLight.quaternion)
    rectAreaLightHelper.update()
})


```

# Shadows

The goal with shadows is to draw realistic shadows with keeping a reasonable frame rate.
How Three.js creates shadows is it first does a render for each light that is suppose to create shadows. These renders simulate what the light sees - similar to what a camera sees. It then creates a MeshDepthMaterial that replaces all meshes materials.
The result is stored as a shadow maps texture. These are used on every material that is supposed to receive shadows.

![Shadow Map Visualisation](https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_shadowmap_viewer.html)

To activate shadows we set them in the renderer
`renderer.shadowMap.enabled = true`

We then decide for each object in the scene if it can cast shadows or not and set the property `castShadow` to true.
`geo.castShadow = true`

At the end we also have to activate the shadows on the light sources.
`directionalLight.castShadow = true`

`PointLight,DirectionalLight,SpotLight` allow to activate shadows.

## Optimization of shadow maps

Generally one problem with shadow maps in Three.js is that it handles every shadow map for every object by itself so if you have multiple objects it doesn't merge the shadows of different objects.

Beware of settings to many `PointLights` with shadows in your scene. Three.js creates a cube shadow map and has to render 6 shadow map textures for each side of the directions.

### Size of Render

To improve the shadows we can access the `shadowMap` property to change the size of the shadowmap
`directionalLight.shadowMap.mapSize.width = 1024`
`directionalLight.shadowMap.mapSize.height = 1024`

### Near and far

If you have a situation where your shadow is cropped or you can't see the shadow at all it can be a problem of `near` and `far`. Three.js uses Cameras to render the shadow map so the `near` and `far` values of these cameras can cut off the shadow.

We can access the camera that is used for a shadow map with `light.shadow.camera`
To see the `near` and `far` values it can be useful to use a
`CameraHelper`
`const lightCameraHelper = new THREE.CameraHelper(light.shadow.camera)`
`scene.add(lightCameraHelper)`

We then can adjust the `near` and `far` values
`light.shadow.camera.near = 1`
`light.shadow.camera.far = 6`

### Amplitude

For [DirectionalLight](#directionallight) Three.js uses a [OrthographicCamera](#orthographic-camera). We can adjust and reduce the field of view to create more accurate shadows - the smaller the values the more accurate the shadows - but only reduce the values till you cut off your shadows.

```JS
directionalLight.shadow.camera.top = 2
directionalLight.shadow.camera.right = 2
directionalLight.shadow.camera.bottom = -2
directionalLight.shadow.camera.left = -2
```

For [SpotLight](#spotlight) Three.js uses a [Perspective Camera](#perspectivecamera) so have to set the field of view `.fov` property.
`spotLight.shadow.camera.fov = 20`

### Blur

To reduce the sharp edges of your shadow if can make sense to add some `blur` to your shadows.
`light.shadow.radius = 5`

### Shadow map algorithm

Three.js has different types of shadow map algorithms that we can use:

- `THREE.BasicShadowMap` - Very performant but low quality
- `THREE.PCFShadowMap` - Less performant with smoother edges
- `THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap` - Less performant but edges are even smoother
- `THREE.VSMShadowMap` - Less performant

We can set the shadow map algorithm with `renderer.shadowMap.type = THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap`
Three.js uses `PCFShadowMap` as the default.

### Baking shadows

A good alternative to using Three.js shadows is to bake the shadows similar to [baking the lights](#baking-lights).
The problem is that they only work for non dynamic scenes where the objects don't change there position or rotation.

Another more dynamic way is to bake a shadow and then set it as a material for a plane that lies a little bit over the
ground plane. If the object then comes close to the ground we set the opacity of that material to high and if it far from ground we set it to low

```JS
const sphereShadow = new THREE.Mesh(
    new THREE.PlaneGeometry(1.5, 1.5),
    new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
        color: 0x000000,
        transparent: true,
        alphaMap: simpleShadow
    })
)
...
sphereShadow.position.y = plane.position.y + 0.01
sphereShadow.material.opacity = (1 - sphere.position.y) * 0.3
```

# Optimizations

Use one material and one geometry for multiple meshes.
If you create a loop to create multiple meshes set the material and the geometry outside

```JS
const material = new THREE.MeshMatcapMaterial({matcap:matcapTexture});

const geo = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1,1,1);

for(let i = 0; i<100;i++){
  const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geo,material);
}

```

# Change background of Scene

We can change the background of our scene with
`scene.background = new THREE.Color(0xffffff)`

# Add Gizmo to object

With _TransformControls_ you can add a gizmo to an object so you can move an object.

_DragControls_ allows you to move an object ona plane facing the camera by drag and drop them.

# Interactions

## Mouse Movement

We can use the mouse to set the position of our camera and let the camera always look at the object.

To get the mouse position we listen to the JS event `mousemove` with the `addEventListener`

```JS
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75,window.innerWidth/window.innerHeight,1,100);

camera.position.z = 10
camera.lookAt(mesh.position);
scene.add(camera);

```

### Doing full rotation around object

By using `Math.PI` we can map the mouse position onto a specific angle on the circle. So we translate the camera on a circle shape around the object and let it look at the object.

```JS
const radius = 2;
camera.position.x = Math.sin(Math.PI * 2 *cursor.x)*radius;
camera.position.z = Math.cos(Math.PI *2 * cursor.x)*radius;
camera.position.y = cursor.x * 2;
camera.lookAt(mesh.position)
```

## Scrolling

```JS
    // First define your variables
    let scrollTotal = 0;
    const scrollSpeed = 0.1;
    const scrollMin = 0;
    const scrollMax = 500;
    let scrollPathPos = 0;

    // Define the function first
    const handleWheel = (event) => {
      event.preventDefault();
      const deltaY = event.deltaY || event.detail || -event.wheelDelta;

      // Update total scroll
      scrollTotal += deltaY * scrollSpeed;
      if (scrollTotal < 0) scrollTotal = 0;
      // Clamp the TOTAL scroll value
      const clampedScroll = Math.max(
        scrollMin,
        Math.min(scrollMax, scrollTotal)
      );

      // Map from scroll range to 0-1 range
      scrollPathPos = (clampedScroll - scrollMin) / (scrollMax - scrollMin);

      const pathT = Math.min(1, Math.max(0, scrollPathPos));
      console.log(pathT);

      const camPos = path.getPointAt(pathT);
      camera.position.copy(camPos);
      const tangent = path.getTangentAt(pathT).normalize();
      camera.lookAt(camPos.clone().add(tangent));
    };

    // Then add the event listener
    const domElement = renderer.domElement;
    domElement.addEventListener("wheel", handleWheel, { passive: false });
```

# Vector3 class

### Set Vector

`mesh.position.set(0.2,0.7,0.3)`3

### Get the length of the position vector

`mesh.position.length()`

### Get the distance from another Vector

`mesh.position.distanceTo(camera.position)`

### Normalize Length of Vector

`mesh.position.normalize()`

# Debug UI

There are multiple libraries to create some Debug UIs.
The most popular like [dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui)
or
[control-panel](https://github.com/freeman-lab/control-panel)
[controlkit](https://github.com/automat/controlkit.js)
[guify](https://github.com/colejd/guify)
[oui](https://github.com/wearekuva/oui)

## Dat.GUI

### Implementation

Installation
`npm install --save dat.gui`
Import
`import * as dat from 'dat.gui'`
Instantiation
`const gui = new dat.GUI`

### Elements

`Range` - numbeers with minimum and maximum value
`Color` - for various color formats
`Text` - Simple Text
`Checkbox` - for booleans
`Select` - Choice from list of values
`Button` - to trigger functions
`Folder` - to organize panel with lot of elements

### Add Elements

We add elements with `gui.add(object,property of object)` to add elements to the GUI.

`gui.add(mesh.position, 'y')`

Specifying ranges and steps
`gui.add(mesh.position,'y',-3,3,0.01)`
or use methods from _dat.GUI_.
`gui.add(mesh.position,'y').min(-3).max(3).step(0.01).name('elevation')`

### Set Element visible via GUI

`gui.add(mesh,'visible')`

### Colors

Define object with color as its property
`const parameters = { color: 0xff0000}`
Add object
`gui.addColor(parameters,'color')`

Signaling changes of property in Dat.GUI properts and setting property in three.js

```JS
const parameters = {
  color:0xff0000
}
gui.addColor(parameters,'color')
.onChange(()=> {
  material.color.set(parameters.color)
})

const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color:parameters.color})
```

### Trigger a function

To trigger a function we have to add the function again like with colors to an object.

```Js
import gsap from 'gsap'
...
const parameters = {
  color,0xff0000,
  spin: () => {
    gsap.to(mesh.rotation,{duration:1, y:mesh.rotation.y +Math.PI*2})
  }
}

gui.add(parameters, 'spin')

```

### Hide Panel

We can press `H` to hide the panel
or set it hidden from beginning
`gui.hide()`

### Close Panel

To have your GUI closed at the beginning
`const gui = new dat.GUI({closed:true})`

### Set Width of Panel

`const gui = new dat.GUI({width:400})`

pane.addInput(grassTexture, 'offset', {
  x: {
    min:0,
    max:1,
    step:0.001
  },
  y: {
    min:0,
    max:1,
    step:0.001
  }
})

```

# Ideas

Animate the field of view of the camera from long small to big field of view
![Idea](https://github.com/PineappleBeer/Three.JS-journey/raw/master/07-cameras/files/video-1.gif)

Create a scene where you only see the baked shadows. Use that to tell a story
