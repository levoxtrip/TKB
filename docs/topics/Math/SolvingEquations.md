# Solving Equations

## Understanding variables
The values from unknown in an equation can help us understand how different situations and scenarious work.

A variable is a letter or a symbol that we use instead of an unknown value.

## Understanding equations
An expression combines numbers and varaiables with operations like addition, substraction, multiplication and division.

Expressions help to discribe combinations of known and unknown values in an equation.

We find the value of the expression when the variables are equal to a specific number. 

An equation brings together two expressions. It shows how the variables relate to each other.

An equation is a statementthat two expressions have the same value.

You can solve an equation by finding the values of the variables that make the equation true on both sides of it. Like both sides of a scale that is balanced.

Both expressions of an equation stay equal when the same amount gets subtracted on both sides.
