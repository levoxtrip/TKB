# Algorithmic Drawing
To draw intresting and complex graphics in GLSL it is *It is important to understand one-dimensional mathematical functions and especially their graph on the x-axis* in order to be able to work better with them later.
==Learn and explain the behavior of mathematical functions.==
The behavior of math. functions can be used to draw shapes by changing the colors of the pixels.

# Mathematical Functions
GLSL provides mathematical functions to set or calculate values in the shader.

## Trigonomic Functions
To animate graphics it's a good start to use the trigonimic functions Sine `sin()` and Cosine `cos()`.
