# Docking Operators Together.

It can be useful to dock one operator to another one so they are always together when you move the operator. Problem is obviously that you can loose sight of the operator and forget about it.

R-Click on the operator you want to dock to the other operator.

Click `Dock to`

L-Click on the operator you want it docked to. The little pink arrow on the bottom right shows that an operator is docked to null1

With L-Click on the Arrow you can show the Operator and with R-Click on the docked Operator you can click `Undock`.
