# Parameter Expression vs. Export

*Expressions* allow you to add further manipulations of the parameter like math calculations or referencing values of other Operators. They tend to be a little bit slower

Export tends to be a bit faster but isn't that flexible. But you get an `exportDAT` from that what you can use if needed.
