# Displace Grid With MagnetSOP

To displace specific parts or vertices of SOP shapes, you can use a combination of the Metaball SOP and the Force SOP. The Metaball SOP acts as a magnet, and by adjusting its position, you determine the area of influence on the base shape. When connected to the Force SOP, the vertices in the specified area are displaced according to the Metaball's position and strength, creating a controlled deformation effect.
