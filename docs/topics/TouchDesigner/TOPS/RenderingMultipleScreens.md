# Rendering Multiple screens
When you have multiple screens to render first setup your graphics card and then do the setup in TouchDesigner.

It is recommended that all the screens have the same resolution and the same Hz.

The more things are the same the better for the graphics card.

In `RenderTOP` we can use different render modes:
`Cube Map` - 360°

`Fish Eye` - 180°

`UV Unwrap` - To render Texture for 3D Objects
