# Rhythm 
Most fundamental aspect in music

Rhythm is the placement of sound in time - every sound happens in a specific moment of time.

## Time signatures
In western music rhythms are arranged in *time signatures.*
A time signature defines how many beats are in each measure/bar. A *measure* is a segment of music that contains a set number of beats.
Time signatures are organised like a fraction. 1/4

4 <- How many beats in each measure of music
4 <- Type of note that counts as one beat.

3 <- 3 Beats per measure
4 <- quarter notes
Time signature for waltz music - 1-2-3 1-2-3

The lower note can be seen as a fraction
4 = 1/4 note -> quarter note
2 = 1/2 note -> half note
1 = 1/1 note -> full note 

## Tempo

The *tempo* is the speed of the beat in BPM (Beats per Minute)
120 BPM = 120 Beats per Minute - Clock has 60 Beats per Minute

## Note division

The beats in a time sequenz can get subdivided to broaden the rhythmic pattern.

e.g. in 4/4 time

/4 Quarter note per measure

/8 Eighth note per measure

/16 sixtenth note per measure

Instead of dividing by two we also can divide the beats into 3 parts creating triplets.

## Swing and shuffle
To create more dynamic into the rhythm and rhythmic variation we can use *swings* to change length of certain notes. This leads to a "groovy" or "bouncy" feel of the rhythm.
It means that instead of playing notes eavenly you delay second half of each beat.

E.g. In house music
16th note swing might stretch the first and the third note while shortening the sonc and forth. That creates a "push" and "pull" effect.

## Strong and weak beats

*Downbeat* - The first beat of a measure. Usally the strongest and most emphasized beat in the music. Putting kicks on these beats can create a steady pulse to ground the beat. 

*Upbeat* - Last beat of the measure

*Backbeat* - Beats 2 and 4 are accented by snare drums or claps in most pop and rock music. Rhymic accentuating of even beats.

*Offbeat* - Weaker beats(Snares, Low Frequency, Kicks, Low Tomps) that occur between main beats. Create rhythmic energy and forward movement. The stronger the beats on the offbeats the more the whole beat seems offbeat.

## Syncopation
When you put notes on hits on the weaker beats or between beats to create tension and supprise -> Rhythm feels more complex and exciting.
Instead of only playing on the strong beat you can add hits on the ands(offbeat eigth notes)

## Ghost nodes
Soft quieter hits that are played on weaker beats. Drummers often use ghost nodes on snare drum to add texture and depth to a rhythm. Fill in the spaces between stronger beats.

## Polymeter & Polyrithms
*Polymeter:* When two or more different time signatures are playing at the same time. 
One instrument at 4/4 and the other on 3/4. The length remains the same.

*Polyrhythm:* Two or more rhythms with different numbers of beats are played simultanously. Within same time signature. 3 Nodes gainst 2 beats in single measure.

## Meter and Phasing
*Meter:* How the beats in a measure are grouped. Common groups: Duple, Triple, Quadruple meter

*Phasing:* How do you organise rhythms over long stretches of time like 4,8,16 Measures. Helps guiding flow and structure of song. POints of progression and change.

## Drum machine sounds
Iconic drum machines:
*Roland808:* Deep Boomin Kick Drums(Hip Hop)
*Rolang909:* Sharp punchy snares (House,Techno)

## Highs Mids Lows
It's important how differnt frequencies affect the groove
*Lows:* Kicks and bass heavy instruments - usally placed on strong beats

*Mid:* Like snares and claps often sit on backbeats (2 and 4)

*High* High hats and cymbals to fill in the gaps and create forward motion.
