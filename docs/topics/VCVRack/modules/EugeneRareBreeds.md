We can  use the module to generate and control beat patterns. Full circles show the hits of the rhythm.

*Length* - controls the amount of beats in a rhythm.

*Hits* - controls the number of hits that trigger an output signal in rhythm.

*Shift* - alters/changes the start point of a rhythm

To alter the parameters from above we can input CV values at the CV knobs.

*REV* button and CV input allow you to reverse the pattern either manually or with a gate control voltage.

*INV* button and CV input invert hits and no hits. When *INV* active the empty circles are the hits of the pattern. 

*EOC* triggers an output signal when the end of circle is reached. The module has different EOC modes:
- *On Repeat*: triggers on first beat of the cycle only when whole cycle ran through
- *First*: triggers on first beat of cycle even when resetted.
- *Last*: triggers on last beat
