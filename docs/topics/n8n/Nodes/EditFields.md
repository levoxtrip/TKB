# Edit Fields (Set)
Edit Fields Node is used to managing data in your items for example:
- add data to items
- format data in items
- reduce data in items

Use `Edit Fields` as much as possible so you only keep the data that is useful to you.
We have the options to only keep the fields that we are setting or to include all the input fields
