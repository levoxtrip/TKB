# How to Server
Whenever you send out some data to some other entity you have to transform that data into *sendable* data. This assures also that the receiver can properly read it. 

## Protocols
- OSC
- MQTT - VL.IO.MQTT [Here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.IO.MQTT)
- UDP - PC to PC

## MQTT
`MQTT Client` is main node for *sending* and *receiving* data.
