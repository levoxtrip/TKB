# Nugets
## Import Nugets
To import *Nugets* into the VVVV sketch you first can go to `nuget.org` to find the correct name of the nuget you want to import.
Then go to *Menu -> Manage nuget -> commandline -> nuget install VL.nugetName*

We also can import DOT.NET packages.

## Delete nuget
To delete a *nuget* from you patch go to *quad menu -> manage nugets -> show installed*
and then delete the folder.
