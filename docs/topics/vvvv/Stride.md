# Stride
`Stride` is the build-in 3D render engine of vvvv. 
Stride contains primitives, shaders, lights and more. We output our stride composition into a `SceneWindow`.

## Shortcuts
Reset camera in `RenderWindow` - `R`
Show helper in Scene - `F4`

# Transformations
For basic information about transformations [see here](Skia.md#transform).

## Transform between
The `TransformBetween` node allows to transform a shape so it is positioned between the two input positions.

![TransformLineBetweenTwoWanderer](./img/TransformBetweenTwoWanderer.png)

## Child Transformations
To have shape being transformed relative to a parent shape we can set them as a *Child* entity to the parent.

![Children Transformations](./img/ChildrenTransformation.png)


## Scale shape uniformly
The `UniformScale` allows us to scale a shape on all three axis with one scalar value.

# Materials
With the `ColorMaterial` node we can set a material for the meshes of the primitives. Stride also has `TextureMaterial`, `PBRMaterials`.

## Color Material
When using `Color Material` shading is disabled and lights won'T have any effect on the volume.

## PBR Material
`PBRMaterials` enable shadows and the define how lights will be reflected on the volume.

To set the transparency on a `PBRMaterial` we can use a `Blend` node and set alpha value.

### Texture as Diffuse Color of PBR
With a `ColorMap` node we can translate a texture into a diffuse color input for pbr materials

## TextureMaterial
If we want to apply textures to our model we can load the texture with `FileTexture`plug that into a `TextureMaterial`.

# Primitives
*Stride* brings build-in primitives:
- Box
- BoxSphere 
- Capsule
- Cone
- Cylinder
- Disc
- Plane 
- Sphere
- Teapot 
- Torus

# Data types
*Entity* - models, lights, cameras
*Material* - change look of entities when rendered
*Texture* - image format


# Group
We can combine multiple primitives in a `Group` node.

## Group spread of elements
After a Loop we get a spread of entities. With a `Group(Spectral)` node we can convert the spread into a single entity.



# Light
To see something in our scene we should add a light source. 
Stride has multiple lights:
- AmbientLight
- DirectionalLight
- SkyboxLight
- PointLight

We also can add multiple light source with a `Group` node.
![GroupingLights](./img/GroupingLights.png)


## SkyboxLight
Allows you to add your own cubemap as the *light* source.

## Shadows
In the primitive node we can define if it is a `ShadowCaster` or not.

# Camera
When there is no Camera connected to the scene VVVV assumes the default orbit camera, which allows you to navigate through the scene.

When you put your own camera they need to be connected to the `root scene` and the `SceneWindow`

# Render
To render our scene we need to join the `primitives`, `groups`,`lights` in a `RootScene`. This then get's plugged into 
the `SceneWindow`

In the `SceneWindow we can set also the background color of our render.

## Render out image
When we want to just render our scene as an image we can plug `RootScene`and `Camera` into a `SceneTexture` and then connect this to a `TextureWindow` node.

### FullScreenQuadRenderer
We can use `FullScreenQuadRenderer` to show a texture or image full screen in the `RenderWindow`.

![FullScreen Quad Renderer](./img/FullScreenQuadRenderer.png)


## Render Mesh in Wireframe
Stride has a `Wireframe` node that allows to render a `MeshRenderer` with a wireframe material. It is a *advanced* node.


# PostFX
We can apply `PostFX` by plugging the node into the `SceneWindow` PostFX input.

Or we render into `RenderTexture`


## Fog
The `Fog` node enables fog in the scene.

## Outline
`Outline` creates a cartoon style effect.

## Grain
We can apply grain by plugging `FilmGrain` in to a `Cons(Collection.Spread)` and then into Color Transforms input.
![alt text](./img/ApplyGrainPostFXStride.png)

## LightStreak
Shining effect along bright areas direction.

## LocalReflection
If you have for example a metal material for your shape and you want that the other objects in the scene get properly reflected on the material
we can use `LocalReflection` PostFX node. It can affect your performance.

# Shortcuts
Reset view - `long press r`

# Convert 3D into 2D texture
Instead of outputting `RootScene` into `SceneWindow` we connect it to `SceneTexture`. Also plugin a `FlatCamera` mode into the `SceneTexture`. We then can use *Stride.TextureFX* to further manipulate the texture.

# Texture
Stride offers static and dynamic texture sources
-`BubbleNoise`
-`Checkerboard`
-`Color`
-`ColorPalette`
-`Gradient`
-`Halo`
-`Halo(Gradient)`
-`Liquish`
-`Mandelbrot`
-`Neurons`
-`Noise`
-`Circle`
-`Electricity`
-`Polygon` - allows to draw shapes from a multi point input - good to draw a data line with polygon
-`Rectangle`
-`SkiaTexture`


## Specific drawing techniques

### Draw a line with Polygon Node
![Draw A Line With Polygon](./img/DrawALineWithPolygon.png)

## Filters
Stride also offers a lot of *Filter* Shaders to manipulate the textures.

- `ShiftRGB`
- `Threshold`
- `Quantize` - reduce colors of input to stepped color output
- `HSCB`- hue,saturation,contrast,brightness color correction

## Mixers
We can combine multiple texture with *mixer* nodes.
- `Blend` - Blend between two textures using different blending options.
- `Pixelate` - Blend between two textures using pixelate effect
- `Dissolve` - Blend between texture using rough pixely effect

# Video 
In Stride we have to convert a `VideoIn` or `VideoPlayer` with a `VideoSourceToTexture` node and then we can use it as an input for `TextureMaterial` or when *Stride.TextureFX* enabled into a `TextureWindow`

# Mixing Skia and Stride
`SkiaTexture` transforms skia drawing into a texture. This allows us to use it for 3D objects material or apply texture effects to it.

![Skia To Stride With RenderEntity](./img/SkiaToStrideRenderEntity.png)
A performant way to show Skia in stride is to use `SkiaRenderer` and input it into a `RenderEntity`. This we then can add to the `RootScene` of Stride.



# Convert Vector3 to Vector2
`XY` Node lets you quickly pick first to values of `Vector3` and outputs `Vector2` data type.


# Load Model into stride
With the `FileModel`we can load fbx obj files into stride.
If you don't see the model you probably need to adapt the import scale size in the node

To preview the model in the scene we can use `ModelEntity`

![Assigning Textures Model](./img/AssigningTexturesModel.png)

To assign the textures to our model we need a combination of `FileTexture`, `FileTextureGrayScale` and `FileTextureNormalMap`

# Get data from Mesh
To get the data like positions of vertex, uvs, normals etc we can first pick the mesh we want from our model with `GetMeshes` and then split the data with `MeshSplit`. 

 ![Get Mesh Data](./img/GetMeshData.png)

# GPU Instancing
To do GPU Instancing in Stride we need a spread of position data and feed it into a `InstancingSpreadComponent`. This we can transform into *Component* value with `FromValue(Spread)` and feed it for example into a `Box` as component.

![Basic GPU Instancing](./img/GPUInstancing.png)

We also can convert the position data into color values with `Vector3(Split)`, feed it into a `RGBA` node and then collect the color data in `ColorPerInstance`


# Background
If you want to create for example a gradient background for your Stride scene you can add a `Background(Stride.Models)` node to your `RootScene`. You then can add `Gradient` node from Stride.TextureFX as a *Texture* input into the `Background`.
